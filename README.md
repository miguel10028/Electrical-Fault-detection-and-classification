Taken from --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esathyaprakash/electrical-fault-detection-and-classification

They have modeled a power system in MATLAB to simulate fault analysis. The power system consists of 4 generators of 11 Ã— 10^3 V, each pair located at each end of the transmission line. Transformers are present in between to simulate and study the various faults at the midpoint of the transmission line.
